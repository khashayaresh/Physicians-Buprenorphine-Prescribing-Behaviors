## Abstract

The opioid overdose crisis affects 2.1 million Americans with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine is an effective treatment that reduces mortality and supports recovery, yet physician perceptions and behaviors influence its prescribing. Understanding these factors is crucial for expanding access.  

This study examines California physicians' prescribing behaviors regarding buprenorphine for OUD through a cross-sectional survey (n = 101). Descriptive and inferential analyses revealed that most respondents perceived limited demand for buprenorphine and inadequate naloxone access in overdose cases. Gender, ethnicity, community type, and DATA-Waiver status were associated with significant differences in perceptions.  

Findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address training challenges, DEA interference concerns, and systemic barriers to OUD treatment access.
